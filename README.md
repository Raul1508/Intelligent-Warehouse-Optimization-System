## 🚀 How to Use This Software
Please, use the software in the following sequence:

#**1.** Place all required files from the `src/` and `data/` folders into a single working directory to ensure the software runs properly. 

#**2.** Open Menu.py using your preferred code editor (visual studio code) or IDE (Pycharm). Alternatively, run it directly from the terminal: python Menu.py

#**3.** It is recommended to use one layer for the study of storage approaches.

#**3.** Digit the constraints for warehouse dimensions and create a blank layout design, and create each area afterwards.

#**5.** Click on product allocation to get access for placing automamtically new products from predefined brands and features (given by the user).

#**6.** You can explore the set up features! (for both intelligent floor and storage set up).

#**7.** After exit from the software you can open simulation_result_optimum_3.py to find the optimum storage approach and analytics, this will display a Genetic Algorithm evolution at some point of the complex analysis.

#**Note:** The analysis done in **7** does not have an impact over the placement of products showcased in step **5** (triggered by Menu.py). To see the analysis result and formal comparison see the outcome from Result_Analysis_4_storage_approaches.csv file.
